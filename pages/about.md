Jason Fisher is a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [Idaho Water Science Center](http://id.water.usgs.gov/).
He received a B.S. in environmental resources engineering and a M.S. in environmental systems from Humboldt State University,
and a M.S. and Ph.D. in civil engineering from the University of California Los Angeles.
Jason started his research career at the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station, 1997--2001.
After completing his education, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Engineering at University of California Merced, 2004--2008.
In 2008, he moved to the USGS where he is the lead modeler at the [Idaho National Laboratory Project Office](http://id.water.usgs.gov/INL/).
His research experience is varied, including groundwater flow and contaminant transport simulations,
optimization of long-term monitoring networks, multilevel groundwater monitoring, and water-quality characteristics and trends.
Recently he has been focusing on reproducible model building; see his [wrv](https://github.com/USGS-R/wrv) package.

Jason rarely blogs---what few posts he has written are organized by [tags](/tags.html), [categories](/categories.html), and [date](/archive.html).
His blog posts related to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/)-programming language are aggregated by [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/).
