I'm a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [Idaho Water Science Center](https://id.water.usgs.gov/).
I received a B.S. in environmental resources engineering and a M.S. in environmental systems from Humboldt State University,
and a M.S. and Ph.D. in civil engineering from the University of California Los Angeles.
My research career started at the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station, 1997--2001.
After completing my education, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Engineering at University of California Merced, 2004--2008.
In 2008, I moved to the USGS where I'm the lead modeler at the [Idaho National Laboratory Project Office](https://id.water.usgs.gov/INL/).
My research experience is varied, including groundwater flow and contaminant transport simulations,
optimization of long-term monitoring networks, multilevel groundwater monitoring,
water-quality characteristics and trends, and hillslope hydrology.
Recently I've been focusing on [reproducible model building]({{ site.github.url }}/r/2016/08/04/wrv-case-study).

My science goal is to utilize collected field data to develop models for groundwater systems,
and to determine and monitor trends of groundwater movement and chemical transport in complex geologic settings, such as fractured rock.
Groundwater models are necessary for the sustainable management of water resources.
The goal is to design models that facilitate future flexibility; that is,
as new data become available, and our understanding of the groundwater system improves,
the model should be easily adapted and extended to deal with this new information.

I rarely blog---what few posts I've written are organized by [tags](/tags.html), [categories](/categories.html), and [date](/archive.html).
My blog posts related to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/)-programming language are aggregated by [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).
